Workmen engaged on the restoration of Coventry Cathedral sanctuary discovered a brick vault containing two wooden coffins. The vault was close to the altar rails, and its existence had been forgotten. From plates on the coffins it was ascertained that they were those of Mr. Richard William Clay, who died on October 28, 1817, aged twenty-eight, and Emma Ann Clay, aged two, who died on February 19, 1796. When the sanctuary floor has been lowered slightly the vault will be re-covered. The Provost (the Rev. R.T. Howard) would like to find out if there are any descendants of the Clay family living in the city.

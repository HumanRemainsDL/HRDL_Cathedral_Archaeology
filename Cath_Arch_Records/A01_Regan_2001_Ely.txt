Thirty two inhumations of late Saxon to thirteenth century date, some of whch are truncated by other graves. The burials appear to be part of the lay cemetery which covered the entire area to the north of the cathedral prior to the construction of the Lady Chapel. A high proportion of child burials were discovered clustered towards the north transept wall which may result from the belief in the Anglo-Saxon period that rain water run-off from the roof would effectively 'baptise' the children. See additional entry  for further disturbance to the burials in the Victorian period. Reburied in Cathedral precinct.

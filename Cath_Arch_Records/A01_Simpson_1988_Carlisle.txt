Charnel pit containing circa twenty individuals including men, women, and children of probable medieval date. The remains were discovered in a square shaft measuring 6ft by 6ft located as close to the nave foundations as possible. The excavators suggest the bones were collected from burials elsewhere and probably placed in a charnel house until eventually being buried beside the Cathedral (Simpson 1988, 89).

Sixteen undisturbed adult inhumations of Late Saxon date, buried prior to the construction to the Chapter House. The inhumations belong to a Late Saxon cemetery dating circa 800 to 1077. Where identifiable, the sex of the skeletons is male or probably male. The burials were in wooden coffins and many had pillows of flint or flint and tile. Occasional iron nails were found, along with a hooked tag. The burials are thought to relate to three generations of a male religious community.

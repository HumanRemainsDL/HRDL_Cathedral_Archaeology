Three stone coffins, one of which is believed to contain the remains of a Bishop of Lincoln have been discovered by excavators at work in Lincoln Cathedral. The tombs have been discovered near Bishop Longland's Chantry, lying close together about three feet from the surface, only a few feet from the position where, a few years ago, a coffin containing the skeleton of a woman was found. A pewter chalice and paten were found at the head of the coffin which it is believed contains the remains of the bishop. It was in 1909 that the last coffins containing the remains of unidentified bishops were found.

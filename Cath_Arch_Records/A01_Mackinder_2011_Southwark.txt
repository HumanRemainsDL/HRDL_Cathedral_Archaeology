Undisturbed lead coffins within a brick lined burial vault constructed in the 17th century. At least 13 coffins were identified, with the latest being mid 19th century. Spoil from the vault was excavated so that it could be used to inter burials disturbed by the
current Thameslink works at Borough Viaduct (Mackinder 2011).

Medieval exhumation of one or potentially two late Roman burials from a mortuary chamber. The chamber was built in the 4th century and was discovered to contain charnel of middle to late Saxon date, deposited in the mid-10th century. The clearance of the Roman remains must therefore have occured between the 4th and 10th centuries.

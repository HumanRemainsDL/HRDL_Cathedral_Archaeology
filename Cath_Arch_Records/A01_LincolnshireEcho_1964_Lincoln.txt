CATHEDRAL DISCOVERY My memory was not at fault except in some unimportant particulars when I recounted the story of the wonderfully preserved body of an entombed woman being unearthed at Lincoln Cathedral some years ago. The discovery of an ancient coffin containing a body (as opposed to a skeleton) near Rome reminded me that some years ago I had been told of a somewhat similar discovery at the Cathedral. Since then I have been looking into records but it was Canon Cook the former Sub-dean who finally led me to the spot and to one of the men who was actually present when the coffin was found and its lid prised open by order of the then Clerk of Works Mr Robert S Godfrey. The story re-told to me this week by that workman was this: One day in 1923 stone slabs were being relaid in the north-west lobby of the Cathedral when a workman’s pick struck solid stone. Careful probing revealed a coffin. Mr Godfrey was called and he gave instructions for the lid to be lifted. And for a few seconds the perfectly preserved features of a beautiful woman were exposed to view. For a few seconds only for as the little group of men watched the flesh crumbled away dust the lovely white shroud with a coloured neckline breaking and falling on to the bones. The lid was replaced and the earth shovelled back on the last resting place. “an animated animating beauty with a complexion of the most exquisite brilliancy” PARAGON OF ALL THE VIRTUES For that is part the description of the lady herself the twice married daughter of a distinguished soldier She had died almost a century and a half earlier as is recorded in her epitaph on a tablet above the grave Here it is full: “Here entombed Dame Harriot of Lieut-Genetal Churchill wife in her first marriage of Everard Fawkener Kt in her second to Governor Pownall She dyed February 6 1777 51 “Her person that of an animated animating beauty with complexion of the most exquisite brilliancy unfaded fell “Her understanding of such quickness reach thought that her knowledge although she had learning instant and original “DELIGHT OF THE WORLD” “Her heart warm’d with universal benevolence to highest degree of sensibility had ready tear for pity glowed with friendship with sacred and inviolate fire Her love to those who were blest with it happiness “Her sentiments were correct refined elevated : her manners so cheerful elegant winning amiable that while she admired she beloved and while enlightened and enlivened she was delight of the world which lived “She formed for life she was prepared for death which being gentle wafting to immortality’ she lives where life is real”

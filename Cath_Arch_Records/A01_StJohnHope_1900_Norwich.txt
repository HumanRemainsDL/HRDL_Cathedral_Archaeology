Disturbance of postmedieval inhumations in the search for the remains of St William, Bishop Thomas Brown, and Bishop Walter Lyhert in 1899. Excavations focussed on the central part of the Nave at the East end. Among the graves opened were those suspected to have been of Bishop Lyhert and Johannis de Bredelynton. Lyhert was found with a wooden Crozier which was lifted, recorded, and then placed back in the tomb 'by the Deans wish'. An unnamed burial was also found containing a copper alloy finger ring. This ring was removed from the body and stored elsewhere (text does not indicate where). All human remains were apparently left insitu.

Mr J. S. Richardson, Edinburgh, of the Ancient Monuments Board, yesterday morning opened the thirteenth century tomb which was discovered in the north transept of St Andrew's Cathedral. With some difficulty the large slab of stone which covered the tomb was raised. The stone coffin was three quarters full of earth. Mr Richardson and his assistants carefully removed this earth and found the remains of an old wooden coffin containing a skeleton. The discovery of the tomb was made a few weeks ago when workmen who were engaged examining the various lower levels of the Cathedral discovered the large top slab about eighteen inches under the floor level in the north transept.

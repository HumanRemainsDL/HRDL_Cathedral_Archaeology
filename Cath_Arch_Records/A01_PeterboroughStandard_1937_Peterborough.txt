The work that is proceeding on levelling the floor od the retrochoir or eastern chapel of the Cathedral has revealed the graves of many prominent citizens of the 16th and 17th centuries. To use Mr W. T. Mellows' word, the ground beneath is "honeycombed" with graves, and one estimate puts the number at 66. The graves are being filled in and then overtopped with concrete to form a firmer base on which to lay the paving stone. All the grave slabs are being replaced in their original positions. As the graves have been uncovered, skeletons and parts of skeletons have been left untouched. Among the graves opened was that of Sir Humphrey Orme and his wife, whose monument in the south approach to the retrochoir was battered and disfigured by Cromwellian troops.

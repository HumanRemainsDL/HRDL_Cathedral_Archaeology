Circa 122 medieval and postmedieval graves. Many are thought to have been robbed or partially destroyed or wholly destroyed in the 1640-1650s. These graves were subsequently completely cleared in 1787 during the reflooring of the nave / side aisles / and south-west transept. Excavations in 1993 revealed some graves contained 17th century material while most contained rubble from the 18th century clearance. Several charnel pits were discovered during the 1993 excavation which probably contain the remains of several of these burials; these are recorded in an associated record.

Workmen laying underfloor heating in Lincoln Cathedral found a tomb, a few feet from a slab inscribed with the name of Bishop Lexington and the date 1258. The stone coffin contained bones and fragments of clothing, but there is no inscription on it. No ring or chalice was found with the remains. The skeleton lay with its feet pointing to the east, but bishops were buried in those days the other way round, "facing their flock". The sub-dean of the cathedral, Canon Peter Binnall, said today: "We feel satisfied that the tomb is not Bishop Lexington's. It could be that of a dean or a sub-dean, or even of a cathedral benefactor of the thirteenth century".

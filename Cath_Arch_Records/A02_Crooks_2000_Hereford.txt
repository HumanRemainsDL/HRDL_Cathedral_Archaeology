Charnel deposited within a stone cist. The cist was a small stone structure capped with a single irregular slab of Old Red Sandstone. One side of the cist was formed by the footing of the treasury extension built about AD1500. No detailed analysis of the charnel was undertaken though it contained the remains of more than one individual.

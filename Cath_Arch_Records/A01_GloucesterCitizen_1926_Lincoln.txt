In 1926 as part of repairs to the Angel Choir the supposed tomb of Bishop Remigius - founder of Lincoln Cathedral - was opened. A lead coffin was found containing a skeleton. A chalice and a fragment of a crozier were also found. The skeleton was assumed to be that of Remigius given that the coffin was small and that Bishop Remigius was traditionally noted for his small stature.
